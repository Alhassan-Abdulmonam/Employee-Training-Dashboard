# Employee-Training-Dashboard

Project Description:
This project involves developing an interactive Power BI dashboard that tracks the completion of learning modules by employees across various departments. The dashboard provides insights into employee performance by filtering data based on hierarchy, time, and band levels. Key features include the ability to view completion rates for specific modules (e.g., FCG, IFCG, SAM1) and a breakdown of completed, failed, and incomplete statuses. Additionally, it enables managers to monitor the progress of their teams by navigating through different levels of the organizational hierarchy, ensuring a clear understanding of overall learning progress.
